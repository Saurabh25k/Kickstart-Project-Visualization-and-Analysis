 Recently, I worked on a mini project where I analyzed a massive Kickstarter dataset with over 370,000+ records and 11 key features.

Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I cleaned the data, extracted important insights, and created 8 different types of visualizations â€” including bar plots, pie charts, scatter plots, line charts, heatmaps, and more!

It was an amazing experience handling real-world data at scale, applying EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and visual storytelling through graphs.

This project helped me improve my data handling, plotting, and Python skills.

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!
